# Word-Ladder-Solver
C program that generates the shortest transformation path between two words using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. 

## What I Learned & Built
The Word Ladder Generator is a C program that builds the shortest sequence of word transformations between two given words. Each intermediate word in the ladder differs by exactly one letter and must be a valid entry from the provided dictionary file.

The program uses linked lists and queues to represent and manage ladders, applying a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to efficiently explore all possible transformations until a valid path is found.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of fundamental C programming concepts, including:

-Dynamic memory management with malloc and free

-File I/O to read and filter dictionary data

-String manipulation and comparison

-Data structure design for managing ladders and word storage

-Testing and debugging using custom unit tests and Valgrind
