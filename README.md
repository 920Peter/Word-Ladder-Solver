# Word-Ladder-Solver
C program that generates the shortest transformation path between two words using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. 

The Word Ladder Generator is a C application that constructs the shortest transformation sequence between two words, where each intermediate word differs by only one letter and must exist in a given dictionary.

The program uses data structures such as linked lists and queues to represent word ladders and efficiently explore valid transformations using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy.

This project demonstrates strong skills in:

Dynamic memory management (malloc, free)

File I/O for reading dictionary word lists

String manipulation and validation logic

Data structure design (linked lists for ladders, queues for BFS)

Testing and debugging with Valgrind and unit test functions
